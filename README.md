## 📄Description – Exercise Statement
This project involves creating a Java class with a method that deliberately throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when accessing an invalid array index.

A JUnit test class is implemented to verify that the exception is correctly thrown under the specified conditions.

## 💻Technologies Used
Java 17

IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java-compatible IDE)

JUnit 5 (with exception testing)

Git & GitHub (for version control)

## 📋Requirements
Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

JUnit 5

Git (optional, for version control)

## 🛠️Installation
Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

Ensure the JDK is configured properly.

Make sure JUnit 5 is available in the project dependencies.

## ▶️Execution
✅ Running the Program:
If a main method is included for manual testing:

bash
Copiar
Editar
javac ArrayExceptionExample.java
java ArrayExceptionExample
✅ Running the JUnit Test:
Use your IDE to execute the JUnit test class.
The test should validate that the method correctly throws an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when attempting to access an invalid index.

## 🌐Deployment
This is an educational and standalone example intended for local execution. Deployment to a server or cloud environment is not required.
